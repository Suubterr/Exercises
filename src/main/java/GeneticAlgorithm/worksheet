How to calculate a fitness of a given chromosome fo sum and product of given list?

 list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
 chromosome example = [0010010111]
 0 is for sum
 1 is for product

    score = sqrt((chromosome sum - ideal sum)^2+(chromosome product - ideal product)^2)
    fitness = 1/score + 1

    if fitness == 1 -> WIN! :)
    if 1 < fitness -> no win :(

    To make it work you need to generate random chromosomes and test it against this formula
  to pick the most fit ones and then splice them and join with each other
  and repeat the whole process until you get the solution.
